Motion profiling++.

### Changelog

* March 24, 2019: completed the first full version of the motion profiler. Still needs to be tested on Processing, but given an array of points the math works out.
* April 11, 2019: added quintic spline interpolation. This is to be used instead of a path injector and smoother.
